                <p>Hello! I am currently a student at Bahcesehir College Science High School, currently in my junior year (2024-2025). I have a great interest in physics and I aim to improve myself in this field. I am also currently actively involved in popular science activities and I am working to bring science to more people in the right way.</p>
                <p>Since March 2023, I have been the editor-in-chief of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://evrimagaci.org">Tree of Evolution (Evrim Ağacı)</a>, Türkiye's largest popular science platform. In parallel, I work as the official Turkish representative of Evrim Ağacı NASA APOD, as well as the translation editor and coordinate the project. For a while, I was on the Board of Directors of the Tree of Evolution Ankara Community and led the establishment of the community. In this community, I took part in organizing physical science events, conferences and social activities. We organized various scientific, certified training activities and reached thousands of people.</p>
                <p>In September 2022, I founded <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://bilimetri.org">Bilimetri</a> to close the gap in Turkish popular science and create an academic-based science communication platform. Bilimetri is a science communication platform where academics act as science advisors, writers and editors. The platform has a software and editorial panel that even reputable publishing organizations around the world do not have. It took until the end of 2024 to complete this whole software process and Bilimetri is now actively publishing. We also produce scientific educational content on the Bilimetri Academy platform. These contents are high quality and scientific approach educational contents. For example, we explain high school subjects whose scientific foundations are not strong enough in a way that high school students can understand. In mathematics subjects, we try to provide students with an in-depth perspective and vision by explaining proofs and definitions. Currently, we mainly produce content in Turkish, but we aim to produce content in English and even other languages in the future.</p>
                <p>In 2023, I co-founded the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://scihook.org">Sci-Hook Organization</a> to expand our scientific activities in Turkish to a global scale. Sci-Hook Organization is a science ecosystem that is constantly updated and developed. Bilimetri was included under this umbrella after the Sci-Hook Organization was established, and it was designed so that science lovers and academics can open accounts in multiple Sci-Hook projects with a single account. At Sci-Hook Organization, we aim to develop academic studies and tools as well as science communication activities. We have project ideas such as data analysis tools that researchers and students can benefit from, and we are currently working hard to realize them.</p>
                <p>I have a high interest in physics and mathematics. In physics, I am interested in quantum mechanics and phase transitions. I am particularly interested in abstract mathematics and set theory and have been conducting research in this area. I also have a strong interest in abiogenesis and evolutionary biology and have participated in the National Biology Olympiad. I have been interested in programming since middle school and have been working on embedded system development. I mainly work with C, C++ and Python languages. Although I have limited experience, I also know .NET and Node.js. I am very interested in giving talks, lectures and attending conferences. I also have an interest in debates and am preparing to participate as a delegate in the 2025 Model United Nations.</p>
                <p>In 2024, we participated in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescendo_(FIRST)">FIRST Robotics Competition CRESCENDO</a> season with our school robotics team and I managed the process as the team captain. I mentored the young members of the team and carried out official communication in processes such as grant collection. Companies like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.boeing.com">Boeing</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.rtx.com">Raytheon</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.dow.com">Dow</a> sponsored our team and covered all our expenses.</p>
                <p>Some of my hobbies are astrophotography, wildlife photography, nature walks, basketball and classical music. I was selected for the TÜBİTAK National Sky Observation Festival, the most prestigious astronomy festival in Türkiye, and I camped at TUG, one of the most advanced telescopes in Türkiye, located at an altitude of 2,500 meters in Saklikent, Antalya. Here I met a lot of new astrophotographers and astronomers and did a lot of shooting. I also gave small-scale workshops to get people interested in astrophotography. For wildlife photography, I went and shot in the most challenging terrains, trying to show people the fascination of nature. I also organized informative events on how to shoot. I have a great interest in classical music and I play classical guitar.</p>
                <p>What I have mentioned so far is very brief information about me. You can review my CV, projects and get more detailed information on other pages of my website. If you have any questions or if there is something you want to advise, do not hesitate to consult. I would be very happy to help you, to hear different ideas and to examine your new project ideas!
